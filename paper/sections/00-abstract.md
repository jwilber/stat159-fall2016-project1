### Abstract
  With the growing popularity of data science and a general push toward computational methods across multiple domains, reproducibile results are more important now than ever. This paper presents several contemporary tools that one can incorporate into their work flow to achieve reproducible results. Five different tools will be discussed, namely Git, GitHub, pandoc, Markdown, and Makefiles. After discussing what these methods are, discussion will turn to how these methods were employed together in the production of this very paper. Finally, the paper will conclude with discussions on reproducibility and further software considerations.
