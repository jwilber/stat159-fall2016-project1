## Introduction

Reproducibility is very important. Without it, one can't really guarantee the results of a given study. With it, one can, regardless of the conclusions.

In the following document, I will discuss five popular tools used for reproducible reserac/data science. The tools I will discuss are as follows:

1. Git
2. GitHub
3. Makefiles
4. Markdown
5. Pandoc

I will discuss the tools in a tutorial-like format. First, I will describe what the tool is and why it is used. Following that description, I will reveal some examples of how to use that technology. For example, when I discuss Makefiles, I will describe what a Makefile is and how it can be used. After that, I will provide instructions and examples of how to construct your own makefile. I will do this piecewise for each of the 5 aforementioned tools.

My goal with this post is to help you get your feet wet with reproducible tools. These tools are very useful - I used all of them in the creation of this document. Theywill set you off on the right path to achieve reproducibility in whatever your domain happens to be. So, without further ado, buen provecho!
