## Conclusion

In conclusion, reproducibility is very important in research and data science because it allows for a concise guarantee of the claims made in a study. That is, a reproducible study will all for verification of results.

In the above write-up, I introduced you to five very important tools that can aid you in your quest for reproducibility: **Git**, **GitHub**, **Makefiles**, **Markdown**, and **Pandoc**. **Git** is a very popular version control sytem that, when used with **GitHub**, allows for a seamless, smooth version control flow wherein which users can easily keep track of multiple projects and changes therein. **Makefiles** are files that allow for easy update of files and the structure of dependency-dependent files/folders.
**Pandoc** allows for easy conversion between file types.

The above five tools are just a few of many that can be used to achieve more reproducible analyses.
